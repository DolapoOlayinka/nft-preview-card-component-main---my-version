Today I decided to try out a new front-end mentor coding task, the NFT Preview card component and before 
I started I just assumed it would be simple HTML and CSS and would take me no more than 30 minutes to complete. 
That was not the case, unfortunately. I had previously worked on several other HTML and CSS challenges and assumed 
they would be similar, making it a snap but I quickly realized they weren't; after all, it's called a challenge for a reason.

HTML and CSS have so many components, and the more projects you work on, the more you'll be exposed to newer areas of the subject, 
which is wonderful for learning. I laid out my html and then had to get into CSS; first, because I hadn't coded in around 2 weeks, 
I found I had forgotten a lot of what I'd learned, so I had to go back over some of my prior projects to refresh my memory which helped me progress in this project. 
For example, I had forgotten about several parts of the flex-box and needed to review them, as well as how to align some contents to the middle of the page.

Overlaying the card image with an icon was the most difficult component of this project for me. When they're in the active states, I had to add an icon and a 
background colour to the image, and this icon had to be centred. I had no idea how to do this, but thanks to Google, stack overflow, w3schools, 30seconds of code, 
and a few other sites, I was able to figure it out. It took me almost 5 hours to finish this project, but I'm glad I was able to work on it and make it as close to the challenge as possible.

If you have any queries about my project, I would be delighted to answer them.
